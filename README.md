It's no secret that I have an incredible love for horror movies. The **31 Nights of Horror** series began in 2015 as a way to work on a fun design and coding project while creating a resource for others who are unsure where to turn for good holiday horror.

### 2019 Summary
Need horror movie recommendations this October? Check out my fifth annual 31 Nights of Horror calendar. Enjoy the month-long themes like High-Tide Tuesday and Witchcraft Wednesday, inline movie trailers, and links to streaming services where you can watch now; many for free! I have an incredible love for horror movies and I look forward to building this project every year.  **Happy Halloween!**
